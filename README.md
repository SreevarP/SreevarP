# TravelingSalesmanVisualization
A brief visualization of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Python Turtle Graphics. Made from scratch

*Args
- n: this is just the number of ciites or nodes to be displayed in the visualization. Time complexity of the program is O(n!), however it is not modeled perfectly. 

*Out
- shortest path is displayed with red along with its distance.

Resources:
- None

Additional Comments:
- This was for a Freshman English TED Talk project. My topic was P vs. NP. I programed this model to be a visualization of the Traveling Salesman Problem, not an extact representation. If you want to read more about my TED Talk, I have given you the PDF of my abstract.
